ColorJumper

Controls:

1 character:

Press left of the little square to make it jump left and right to make it jump right.

2+ characters:

The closest character to screen tap is the one affected. From there, the controls are the same as for one character.


Settings:

Brightness:

Sets the color brightness of the game. Can currently set it to 0
which is bad.

Painfulness:

Sets saturation of the game where 100% gets pretty painful to look at. Again, can currently set it to 0 which washes out the colors to the point of them all being white.

Difficulty:

At the moment there are only two difficulty settings, easy where you control one character and hard where you control two.

That is all.
