<h1>ColorJumper</h1>

<h2>Controls:</h2>

<h3>1 character:</h3>

Press left of the little square to make it jump left and right to make it jump right.

<h3>2+ characters:</h3>

The closest character to screen tap is the one affected. From there, the controls are the same as for one character.

<h2>Settings:</h2>

<h3>Brightness:</h3>

Sets the color brightness of the game. Can currently set it to 0
which is bad.

<h3>Painfulness:</h3>

Sets saturation of the game where 100% gets pretty painful to look at. Again, can currently set it to 0 which washes out the colors to the point of them all being white.

<h3>Difficulty:</h3>

At the moment there are only two difficulty settings, easy where you control one character and hard where you control two.

That is all.
